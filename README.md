# cuddly-guacamole


This is version 2.0 of the [mz-website](https://github.com/mikezawitkowski/mz-website) repo, where earlier iterations can be found.

Why the name of the repo? It was suggested by github, and since the theme for this website was initially very green, I went with the suggestion. So there.
