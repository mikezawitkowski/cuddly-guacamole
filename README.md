# cuddly-guacamole


Replacing the older [mz-website](https://github.com/mikezawitkowski/mz-website) repo, using the [startbootstrap-freelancer](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-freelancer) repo as the foundation.

Normally I ignore suggested repo names, but since this theme was green it seemed like a good fit.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repo (ssh preferred) to local directory
1. run `npm install` if you need those libraries to work with `gulp` etc
1. make changes (with branching optional) and push to/merge with master
1. ssh into server where it will be hosted and `git pull`
1. have cake
